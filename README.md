# nextteo
> Initial port of TEO's front-end application to Next.js

## Installation/Development

To install and develop this application, you'll need a modern version of Node.js (tested on v7.10.0).  Several modern node features like async/await are used, so a fairly current Node.js version lets us keep the Babel transpilation pipeline to a minimum.  Yarn is recommended for dependency-handling, although a recent version of the NPM client should work fine as well.

First, clone this repository, go to the new directory, and install dependencies:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/theelegantoffice/nextteo
$ cd nextteo
$ yarn
```

To run locally for development including hot module replacement, run the dev script:
```bash
$ yarn run dev
```
