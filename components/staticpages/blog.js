        <p className="clpragraph">Color and design trends change; we see this shift in the contemporary materials and colors being used in meeting spaces and offices.  It’s no wonder that the popularity of&nbsp; <a href="https://www.theelegantoffice.com/shop/conference-room-accessories/conference-table-pads/">Conference Table Pads</a> continues to expand along with these advances.  Their minimalist design and clean lines make them especially versatile, either adding an elegant layer in a traditional boardroom or a sleek appearance in a contemporary setting.  Their practical use has application protecting wooden table tops or offering an ideal writing surface on stone or glass.</p>
      </div>
      <p className="clpragraph"> To keep up with the growing needs and requests of customers, we’re pleased to announce two new colors now available in the&nbsp; <a href="https://www.theelegantoffice.com/shop/conference-room-accessories/conference-table-pads/?refinementList%5Bpad_size%5D%5B0%5D=17%20x%2014">17” x 14” Conference Table Pad</a> size –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theelegantoffice.com/products/gray-leatherette-conference-table-pad-17-x-14/">Gray #P4215</a> and White #P4415.  Gray is another neutral so it easily blends with lighter and darker hues of the same or as a complimentary color accent.  It goes without saying that bright white pads bring high contrast and a modern feel – a great accessory for vibrant, sleek backgrounds.  They also provide the ultimate blank canvas, ideal for our new full color printing options (more on that later!).</p>

      <p className="clpragraph">We recently worked with a client who needed to outfit their new boardroom.  Their beautiful marble table top takes center stage in the room.  After viewing samples, they chose the&nbsp; <a href="https://www.theelegantoffice.com/products/gray-leatherette-conference-table-pad-17-x-14/">Gray Leatherette Conference Table Pads</a> as their next accessory.  I think anyone would agree, these add a stunning layer which highlight the veining of the
				stone, rather than distract or hide that unique and organic feature.  Each pad was&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.theelegantoffice.com/pages/add-a-logo/">debossed with their logo</a> adding a sophisticated touch that personalizes each guest’s experience, when seated at the table. The end result is a breathtaking room, each component
				compliments the other.  Most importantly to us however, is knowing that our client is pleased.  That’s the best conclusion.</p>

      <p className="clpragraph"> The same idea of using natural stone as a table top is also being implemented in the office, to create elegant  workspaces.  The look can vary and be influenced by the “movement” found in the stone. For those looking to make a statement, significant patterns may be chosen to give a bold impression. On the opposite side of the
				spectrum, little variation may be selected to create high-end appeal.In either case,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.theelegantoffice.com/shop/desk-accessories/">desk accessories</a> can soften the space and help create a comfortable, organized work area.</p>
      <p className="clpragraph">first saw this statement piece when working with this CEO to determine the best color to accessorize his desk.  Once that variable was known, he listed the items that would be useful in his daily routine.  Many of the products were stocked, so they shipped right away, but others were custom made.  Now that the components are assembled, the look of his office is memorable.  The combination of these organic materials, stone and top-grain leather, seem to go hand in hand.  The leather enhances the color and character of the stone making it an ideal pairing.</p>

Our pads were installed in the room during the first major renovation of the Situation Room, and we are very proud to that they have served 3 different U.S. Presidents without being replaced!</p>

      The Situation Room was founded in 1961 per the orders of then-president John F. Kennedy to combat the lack of credible information the United States had available during the Bay of Pigs incident. During the rooms construction it had secure communications systems  installed that provide live audio, video and other forms of communication. The Situation Room also features some of the most dedicated staffers our country has to offer, tasked with keeping watch on certain sectors of the globe around the clock to keep the White House updated on national security matters or significant worldwide events. One of the most crucial tasks for the group operating the Situation Room is their preparation of the "Morning Book". The book is written each morning for the President, Vice President and White House select senior staff and contains the newest National Intelligence Daily, The State Department’s Morning Summary, plus diplomatic cables and intelligence reports. Also included in this ritual by the Situation Room is the President's Daily Brief, prepared each day by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.</p>

      There has been only one top to bottom renovation of the Situation Room, taking place from 2006 to 2007. It was a massive project and after its conclusion allowed the Situation Room to not only house the National Security Council but also the Department of Homeland Security and the White House Chief of Staff’s office. These changes also helped to update security and communications technology. Pre-renovation the Situation Room used technology rooted in the year 1985 which could lead to misinformation or a breakdown in communication in today’s digital age. The room was completely rebuilt from the bricks up, both due to the amount of ancient technology blocking the way of new technology being implemented, but also so that they could have a much easier time renovating in years to come.</p>

Since then, they’ve been in-use protecting the meeting table from the daily wear and tear of the operations of this busy, pivotal conference facility. The Situation Room hosts roughly 25 regularly-scheduled conferences a day, with approximately 250 regular attendees.
